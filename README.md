# CtCalendarFor

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/ct_calendar_for`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ct_calendar_for'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ct_calendar_for

## Setup

### Popover

To enable the build-in popover functionality remember to add popper, bootstrap (and optionally turbolinks) to your JavaScript. And trigger the popovers like so.

```
document.addEventListener("turbolinks:load", () => {
  $('[data-toggle="popover"]').popover()
  })
  ```

## Usage

### Overview

Call the gem from the view, and use the calendary_type parameter to choose the layout, and use the options to provide feedback to each calendary type.

```
  <%= calendar_for :horizontal, options: {users: users} %>
  <%= calendar_for :annual, options: {year: 2019} %>
```
